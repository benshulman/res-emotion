Analyses for the Relationships and Emotions study. These data are from an emotion regulation task, in which participants viewed a series of photos. After each photo, participants rated how negative their current emotional state was. The substantive analyses focus on effects of the relationship manipulation (between subjects) -- whether participants were prompted to think of a supportive relationship, or an acquaintance. In addition, I assess the effect of participants' emotion regulation by comparing different trial types (within subjects). For each model, I search for the best-fitting auto-regressive (AR) error structure by fitting a series of models with different AR structures, and comparing their AIC values.
